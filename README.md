# Welcome to Gafar's EC2-launch Terraform Repository
# This terraform will launch two EC2 instances

You will need to change the name of the instances and specify your security group or use a default security group.

The EC2 resource has the following arguments:

- Instance type (t2.micro)
- Associate public ip = true
- Security group id
- Tags

# Hope this is helpful, thanks!
